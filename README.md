# HECRASMonte-Carlo (Pseudo-code)

This repository provides a **detailed, language-independent pseudo-code**
description of a workflow for automated HEC-RAS simulations and
Monte Carlo–based uncertainty analysis.

The repository is intended to support **transparency, reproducibility,
and independent re-implementation** of the methodology described in the
associated manuscript.

## Repository Contents

- `pseudocode/`: Detailed pseudo-code describing the full computational workflow

---

## Intended Use

This repository is intended for researchers and practitioners in
hydrology and hydraulic modelling who wish to understand or re-implement
the methodology without direct access to the original source code.
